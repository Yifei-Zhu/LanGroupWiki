## Introduction
Strictly speaking, there is no strict standard for coding languages as long as the correct code syntax is followed.
However, for the sake of code readability, it is advisable for code to adhere to relevant coding conventions and standards.
For example, Python codes should follow the **PEP8- Style Guide for Python Code** ([English](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)/[Chinese](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//zh-google-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/google-python-styleguide/python_language_rules/%23id1))

In this wiki project, for the convenience of everyone for reference, calling, collaboration, and unified management, we encourage everyone to upload Python code in a standardized manner.
Here, we will demonstrate, with specific examples, **how to write Python code in a standardized way in the context of collaborative work in our group's project.**
Our focus will be on key points that require emphasis and commonly encountered issues, without delving into all the specific details.

    A simple calculator class for performing basic arithmetic operations on two input number.

        - Currently, we only implemented addition and subtraction in this class.
        - When calling this class, the sys module must be imported.

Notes:

- At the beginning of the file, it is necessary to specify the author, date, and other information.
- Whenever you define a class or function, you should include a section that describes the function, its purpose, the meanings and formats of its parameters and return values, as well as any considerations for others when calling it.
- Classes are named using CamelCase.
- Global variables and constants are named in uppercase.
- Names all functions and regular variables in lowercase and connects words with an underline.
- Variables or functions starting with a single underscore (_) are considered protected (they won't be included when using from module `import *`).
- Instance variables or methods starting with a double underscore (__) are considered private within the class (for example, `__name__`).
